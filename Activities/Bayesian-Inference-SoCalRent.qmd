In this activity, we will do (Bayesian) statistical inference for the SoCalRent data. There is a *lot* more going on under the hood here; we're just going to focus on the basics.

## Load Packages, Import Data, Massage Data

```{r}
#| label: do this first
here::i_am("Activities/Bayesian-Inference-SoCalRent.qmd")

library(tidyverse)
library(rstanarm)

SoCalRent1 <- read_csv(here::here("Data/SoCalRent1.csv"))
```

In the "Summarizing Linear Models" activity, we removed some of the houses from this dataset. Repeat that now:

```{r}
#| label: create SoCalRent_train


```

## Step 1: Define the Model

Our proposed population model is

$$
\text{Price} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{SqFt} + ERROR
$$

Typically we only care about our proposed population model; there is no null model to worry about.

## Step 2: Define the Priors

In Bayesian statistics, we must formulate an idea of what our model should look like, *before* putting any data into the model. That is, we should have an idea of what we expect $\beta_0$ to be, what we expect $\beta_1$ to be, and what we expect our **ERROR** term to look like. We formalize these ideas into *priors*, or *prior distributions*.

The default priors in the `rstanarm` package are called "weakly informative". For example, the default prior for the slope term formalizes that we don't believe that there should be a very large (or very large negative) value for the slope, but that we really have no idea otherwise.

## Step 3: Fit the Model

```{r}
#| label: fit Bayesian regression model

```

```{r}
#| label: coefficient estimates

```

## Step 4: Investigate the Model

```{r}
#| label: posterior distribution


```

1.  What are these values? How do we get the slope and intercept reported earlier out of these values?

```{r}
#| label: histogram of posterior distribution

```

```{r}
#| label: check a few posterior predictions


```

```{r}
#| label: histogram of interesting predictions

```

1.  What looks weird about these predictions?

```{r}
#| label: posterior predictive check

```

1.  How do we read this graph? What is it telling us?

## Step 5: Obtain Uncertainty (Credible) Intervals

Assuming everything looks okay with our predictions (it doesn't, but we'll assume for now that it's okay), we can then obtain uncertainty (credible) intervals.

Remember how we obtained bootstrap confidence intervals using the middle C% of our bootstrap distribution? The same idea applies to our credible intervals, but instead of using the bootstrap distribution, we use our posterior distribution.

```{r}
#| label: credible interval

```

By default we use 90% credible intervals, because things can get a bit weird out in the tails of the posterior distribution.

1.  How do we interpret this interval?

## Changing the Prior

Recall our prior distribution was "weakly informative", but we have some knowledge of the housing rent market.

We expect that the slope is *probably* positive, and our intuition says it's probably not greater than something like 5 or 10. We can formalize these ideas in a prior distribution.

For example, a normal distribution with mean 3 and standard deviation 1.5 indicates that there's roughly a 2.5% chance of a negative slope and a 2.5% chance of a slope greater than 6. Still fairly uninformative for our purposes, but better than the default prior where we assumed a 50% of a negative slope!

```{r}
#| label: fit model with more informative prior

```

We inclue the `autoscale = TRUE` argument to tell R that if it can find a better prior that works with the same general idea, go ahead and do it.

```{r}
#| label: prior summary - new model

```

Here we see that it chose to use a standard deviation of 3.9 instead of 1.5.

1.  Using this new model, obtain a histogram of the posterior distribution of the slope. Compare the new posterior distribution to the one obtained using the "weakly informative" prior.

```{r}
#| label: histogram of posterior distribution - new model

```

2.  Using this new model, obtain a 90% Bayesian uncertainty interval for the slope. Compare the new interval to the one obtained using the "weakly informative" prior.

```{r}
#| label: credible interval - new model

```
