The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS, pronounced "H-caps") survey is a nationally-standardized survey for measuring patients' perceptions of their hospital experience. Patient responses to survey questions are converted to "linear mean scores" representing the quality of their interaction with the health care staff, the hospital environment, their understanding of what to do after leaving the hospital, and their overall experience. Each score is rated on a scale from 0-100 with higher scores indicating better patient experiences.

A publicly available version of the dataset can be found at (https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/dgck-syfz#data-table). Dr. Wynne downloaded the October 2024 release of this dataset and has already done the data wrangling to include only the "linear mean score" values.
