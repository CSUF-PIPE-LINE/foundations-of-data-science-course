## Outline

-   What is data science?
-   What is data?
-   The data science process.

## Icebreaker Discussion

"Data science" means different things to different people. With your group, discuss:

-   "Buzzwords" that come to mind when you think about data science
-   Data Science components/disciplines that you know about or have heard about
-   What data science means to you and what attracted you to signing up for this class

## What is Data?
Data is a byproduct of careful decisions about who/what to observe, what to record about them, and how (if at all) to manipulate them

## What Is Data Science?

-   There is no singularly agreed-upon definition of data science.

-   A modern discipline - the job "data scientist" has been around for less than 20 years

-   One possible definition: data science is the *craft* of extracting *relevant insights* from data *at scale*

-   There are *wrong* answers but there is not always a singular *right* one


## Three Pillars of Data Science

-   Application Domain: Provides the *motivation* for collecting and analyzing data and the relevant *context* for what the data means

-   Mathematics and Statistics: Provides the *conceptual* tools and thought processes that guide *how* we should collect and analyze data

-   Computer Science: Provides the *computational* tools and thought processes that allow us to collect and analyze data *at scale*

## Jack of All Trades, Master of Some

-   Very few people (certainly not undergraduates!) are experts in all three areas

-   A data scientist typically specializes in one of these areas and "knows enough" about the others to talk intelligently with experts

-   By the end of this course, you will have started critical reflection about which areas you feel strongest in and are most motivated to continue developing in



## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```
