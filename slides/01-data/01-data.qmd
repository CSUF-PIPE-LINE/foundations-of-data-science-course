## Outline

-   What is data science?
-   What is data?
-   The data science process.

## Icebreaker Discussion

"Data science" means different things to different people. With your group, discuss:

-   "Buzzwords" that come to mind when you think about data science
-   Data Science components/disciplines that you know about or have heard about
-   What data science means to you and what attracted you to signing up for this class

## What is Data?

Data is a byproduct of *human decisions* about who/what to observe, what to record about them, and how (if at all) to manipulate them

## What Is Data Science?

-   There is no singularly agreed-upon definition of data science.

-   A modern discipline - the job "data scientist" has been around for less than 20 years

-   One possible definition: data science is the *craft* of extracting *relevant insights* from data *at scale*

-   There are *wrong* answers but there is not always a singular *right* one

## Three Pillars of Data Science

-   Application Domain: Provides the *motivation* for collecting and analyzing data and the relevant *context* for what the data means

-   Mathematics and Statistics: Provides the *conceptual* tools and thought processes that guide *how* we should collect and analyze data

-   Computer Science: Provides the *computational* tools and thought processes that allow us to collect and analyze data *at scale*

## Jack of All Trades, Master of Some

-   Very few people (certainly not undergraduates!) are experts in all three areas

-   A data scientist typically specializes in one of these areas and "knows enough" about the others to talk intelligently with experts

-   By the end of this course, you will have started critical reflection about which areas you feel strongest in and are most motivated to continue developing in

## The Data Science Pipeline

-   The Data Science Pipeline is a six-step process that most data science projects follow

-   The pipeline is not unidirectional: often insights in a later step lead to refinement in an earlier step, or new data comes in that requires us to look at an earlier step with fresh eyes

## Steps in the Data Science Pipeline

1.  Science and Context

2.  Design and Data Collection

3.  Data Massaging

4.  Exploratory Data Analysis

5.  Modeling

6.  Communication and Optimization of Decisions

## Step 1: Science and Context

-   Research questions are often messy and vague

-   Learning more about the problem's context helps us convert the problem into one we can approach using data science

## It is critical to have well-defined research questions/objectives/goals

"Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise." - John Tukey

## Step 2: Design and Data Collection

-   Collected data comes in many forms

    -   Spreadsheet, text, image, audio, video, etc.

-   Data can be collected manually (by humans) or automatically (using sensors and/or computers)

## Statistical Concerns in Design and Data Collection

-   Bias: systematic deviations from the truth

-   Variance: non-systematic deviations due to uncertainty or natural variability

## Non-Statistical Concerns in Design and Data Collection

-   Practicality: time, money, equipment, etc. requirements

-   Ethics: respect for human and animal rights

## Pay Attention to Practical Concerns!

## Step 3: Data Massaging

-   Data is messy and needs to be cleaned

    -   Values may be incorrectly reported or transcribed

    -   Values may be missing

    -   Artifacts from processing may be present

## Data Massaging

-   Data is unwieldy and needs to be wrangled

    -   Data may not be formatted in a way that is conducive to answering the question

    -   Information may be spread across multiple data files
    
    -   You may have a bunch of rows/columns that are irrelevant to your question 
    
    -   Important variables may need to be created from existing ones

## Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Strategically create graphical and numerical summaries that provide insight into the defined research question

-   Always start by exploring variables of interest individually

-   Move on to exploring relationships between two variables

-   Gradually increase complexity

## Exploratory Data Analysis Is a Mindset

-   Search for patterns (or lack thereof) and unusual values that can provide a fuller account of the context being investigated

-   "Good" EDA should lead to patterns/trends/relationships that may motivate modeling aspects

<center>

"Exploratory data analysis is detective work" - John Tukey

<center>

## Step 5: Modeling

-   Often we start with very simple models and gradually build up complexity

-   Modeling is an iterative process, we don't expect to be right the first time

-   Data is "noisy" - there are sources of uncertainty and variability we may not even begin to fathom

-   Modeling allows us to extract a "signal" (trend or pattern) from data

## Why do we model?

-   Inferential models: To build a mechanism for exploring the effect of predictors on the response

-   Predictive models: Use the collective information from the predictors to build reliable predictions for the response variable of upcoming observations

## Step 6: Communication and Decision Making

- A data science project typically "ends" (or at least restarts) once a *conclusion* or *decision* has been communicated

- Data scientists often do not *make* the conclusions/decisions, but rather *recommend* and *justify* them

## Four Critical Questions for Data Science Communication

<center>

What conclusion/decision should be made?

What evidence supports it?

What assumptions have you made?

How sensitive is your analysis to those assumptions being wrong?
